    <h1>Finding New Homes</h1>

    <p>We have brought our handcrafted blankets to children throughout Boston area hospitals. Many children who have lost a relative, who are sick, were involved with house fires, or other devastating incidents like Hurricane Katrina or the tagic events of 9/11 have received blankets through word of mouth. Please contact us if you know a child in need of comfort.</p>
