    <h1>How To Help</h1>

    <h2>Creating Blankets</h2>

    <p>Project Linus welcomes blankets of all styles, including quilts, tied comforters, fleece blankets, crocheted or knitted afghans, and receiving blankets in child-friendly colors. Blankets must be new, handmade and washable. You don't have to be an expert to create a blanket that is beautiful to a child! 
    <br>
    Crochet, knit, quilt or hand-tie a blanket using clean, washable and dryable materials in infant, child or teen-friendly colors. The ideal blanket size is between 36" x 36" and 40" x 60". Please do not use mohair, angora or other fuzzy material because they shed and can cause breathing problems in some children. For more guidelines and ideas please see our blankets page.</p>
