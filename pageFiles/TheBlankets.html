    <h1>The Basics</h1>

    <p>Blankets can be knitted, crocheted, quilted or hand-tied by volunteers of all ages and abilities and are delivered to children in hospitals throughout the world or to any child in need of consolation. </p>
    
    <h2>Blankets of all styles are welcomed, including quilts, tied comforters, fleece blankets, crocheted or knitted afghans, and receiving blankets in child-friendly colors.</h2>

    <h3><i>Tips</i></h3>

    <ul>

      <li>Blankets must be made from NEW, CLEAN, WASHABLE materials in infant, child or teen friendly colors. -Remember, these blankets are meant to be colorful, cheerful, and cuddly.</li>

      <li>Provide your name and address with blanket.</li>

      <li>The ideal blanket size is between 36" x 36" and 40" x 60".</li>

      <li>Blankets should be made from 100% cotton fabric, flannel, polar fleece, or acrylic yarn. Please do not use mohair, angora or other fuzzy material because they shed and can cause breathing problems in some children. </li>

      <li>Please only donate blankets that are free of contaminants. If unusually strong smells due to chemicals used in detergents, fabric softeners and dryer sheets, mold and mildew or smoking products are apparent, most hospitals will discard the blanket rather than jeopardize the health of a patient.</li>

      <li>Always check blankets carefully for pins, and remove any embellishments such as buttons that could fall off and be swallowed.</li>

      <li>For quilting or hand-tied blankets, please be sure to attach all layer at close intervals so that the layers do not separate. Secure the batting into outer seams and if the blanket is tied, please anchor it every 4-6 inches. We don't want it to fall apart the first time it's washed.</li>

      <li>Weave in all yarn ends on crocheted and knitted blankets. </li>

      <li>Do not knot the fringe on two-layered fleece blankets very tightly, this will cause the blanket to "bowl up" and we will just have to cut the fringe off and start again (making a smaller blanket). If you wish to knot the fringe, knot each piece loosely to itself (not to the next piece of fringe) or knot every other piece. This allows the blanket to lie flat.</li>
